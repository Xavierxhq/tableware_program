Here are some settings:
train method: metric
neural network: resnet
batch_size: 64
training set: Dish_recognition/dataset/rename_n5_train_190226(42 classes, 2912 images)
test set: Tableware/DataArgumentation/dataset/n_test(42 classes, 1999 images)
input size: 300x300
and i load a model: /home/ubuntu/Program/Dish_recognition/program/model/chawdoe-hardsample-o-o-run-1-augmentation/a_o_o_8/121_resnet_metric_conv0.05.tar

And, this folder is created for saving trained model, usually,
the best model should be the one named with "chawdoe-hardsample-(o->n5)-n-run-1-augmentation/a_o->n5_1" in it.
