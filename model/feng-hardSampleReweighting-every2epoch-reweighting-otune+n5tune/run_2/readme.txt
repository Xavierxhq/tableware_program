Here are some settings:
train method: metric
neural network: resnet
batch_size: 64
training set: Tableware/DataArgumentation/dataset/n5_train/(42 classes, 210 images)
test set: Tableware/DataArgumentation/dataset/n_test/(42 classes, 1999 images)
input size: 300x300
and i load a model: /home/ubuntu/Program/Dish_recognition/program/model/feng-hardSampleReweighting-every2epoch-reweighting-o/run_1/feng-hardSampleReweighting-every2epoch-reweighting-o_metric.tar

And, this folder is created for saving trained model, usually,
the best model should be the one named with "feng-hardSampleReweighting-every2epoch-reweighting-otune+n5tune/run_2" in it.
