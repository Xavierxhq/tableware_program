This folder is generated on 2019-01-26 00:07:59, marked by xhq-O+N5tuned-continue,
Here are some settings:
train method: metric
neural network: resnet
batch_size: 128
training set: Tableware/DataArgumentation/dataset/o-n5_train/(135 classes, 27977 images)
test set: Tableware/DataArgumentation/dataset/n_test(42 classes, 1999 images)
input size: 224x224
and i load a model: ./model/xhq-O+N5tuned/5_resnet_metric_conv0.05.tar

And, this folder is created for saving trained model, usually,
the best model should be the one named with "xhq-O+N5tuned-continue" in it.
