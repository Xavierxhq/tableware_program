Here are some settings:
train method: metric
neural network: resnet
batch_size: 128
training set: Tableware/DataArgumentation/dataset/o-n10_train/(135 classes, 28187 images)
test set: Tableware/DataArgumentation/dataset/n_test/(42 classes, 1999 images)
input size: 128x128
and i load a model: ./model/xhq_ft/xhq_ft_metric.pth.tar

And, this folder is created for saving trained model, usually,
the best model should be the one named with "feng-HardSample+SampleReweight-O+N10tune-128x128-run4(for verlapate" in it.
