This folder is generated on 2019-02-15 14:29:18, marked by xhq-Hard+Reweight-N10-300x300/run_2,
Here are some settings:
train method: metric
neural network: resnet
batch_size: 64
training set: Tableware/DataArgumentation/dataset/exp_n5_size/n_train_10/(42 classes, 420 images)
test set: Tableware/DataArgumentation/dataset/n_test/(42 classes, 1999 images)
input size: 300x300
and i load a model: /home/ubuntu/Program/Dish_recognition/Task/input size(tune twice)/300x300/xhq-Hard+Reweight-O-300x300/run_1/xhq-Hard+Reweight-O-300x300-5+_metric.tar

And, this folder is created for saving trained model, usually,
the best model should be the one named with "xhq-Hard+Reweight-N10-300x300/run_2" in it.
